# Advent of code 2021
Another year brings another coding practice. This time a reminder and revisit of an old friend `C++`.

This repository contains a few solved task for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) challenge. Note that the code *contains spoilers* for the AOC event so read it with caution.

The solutions are most likely not optimal or _good_. This code should not be taken seriously for various reasons:
- the AOC event requires pretty fast coding in order to not be ridiculously time consuming
- I have chosen `C++` because I want to learn some new features of the language
- if I learn some good practice along the way, I do not go back and refactor previous tasks (again the time consuming reason)
